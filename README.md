<h1 style="text-aligh:centre;">Who am I?</h1>
Hey there stranger, I'm OneNDone, you can call me Hayden. I love working with Technology whether it's old, new, modern, or present; I enjoy whatever is there. I am passionate with Music and Art but have very few years with programming.


<h1 style="text-aligh:centre;">Experiences</h1>

## Lyon-bot
- A multi-functional high-powered Discord bot with thousands of features.
-  I worked on this project for multiple months before finally deciding to give up on it and discountined it after a raid. This Discord bot meant alot to me as it allowed me to make so many friends on Discord and allowed me to have a big community.
## Aja Bot
- This was another multi-functional Discord bot tht was purposfully to remind me about Lyon-bot and the fun time I had with it, however, it never got to launch but I had plenty of fun and sad times programming it.
## Wumpus bot
- I helped programmed this bot for a friend of mine at the time and it was going pretty well but I proceeded to stop coding it for him after he did some things I did not enjoy.
## New Stars
- I was a bug-hunter for the New Stars game on Steam, Thank you @theADAMJR. 
## Milrato Development
- I was once a staff member at the Milrato Development Discord server back in 2022-2023, my position was of course a Trainee before all the stuff went down, server went haywire, and got deleted, etc.
- I hope you remember me @Tomato6966 (It's Hayden!)
